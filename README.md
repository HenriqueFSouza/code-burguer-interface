## ❔ What is the Code Burguer Project for?

This is an application that was created to simulate a Hamburger Shop website where the Admin can manage their products and the clients can make their orders.

It has a login and register page, the main screen with product categories and products on sale, besides a cart screen.

## Main features

It allows the users to have private routes and does not require email and password every time

➕ Create/Edit new products
The admin can create products, add images, and edit them for sale or change some details

🧾 List of Categories and Products for the users:
The user can easily add products to the cart by the products list

📝 Cart page: 
This page allows the user to remove or increase the product before sending the order

## 📁 Page(s)

- **/: Home page with categories list and products on sale least.
- **/produtos: Page with all the products separated by a navbar categories menu
- **/carrinho: Cart page where the user can edit their order before sending
